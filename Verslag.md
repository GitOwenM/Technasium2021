#### Introduction
We have two different programs which predict how a person’s immune system responds to the proteins on the cell membrane. This prediction can be used for the development of vaccines, but two different programs (MHCnuggets and EpitopePredicions) give different results. In this paper we discuss why these programs output different results.

#### Hypothesis
We do not yet have a hypothesis as to why the programs give different results. We suspect it has something to do with the different methods both programs use, but we don’t know enough about this yet.

#### Methods

#### Results
We do not have any results yet.

#### Conclusion
None yet.

#### Discussion
None, because we have no results yet.
