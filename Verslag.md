#### Introduction
We have two different programs which predict how a person’s immune system responds to the proteins on the cell membrane. 

[RJCB: good attempt! Better is more along the lines '[they predict] how well peptides bind to MHC complexes']

This prediction can be used for the development of vaccines, 
but [RJCB: I think the 'but' is funny, I suggest to replace it by a full stop instad :-)]
 
two different programs (MHCnuggets and EpitopePredicions) give different results. In this paper we discuss why these programs output different results.

[RJCB: Again, nice try! Indeed, being able to tell why these programs give different results is nice. But this is not the problem (think a Celcius and Fahrenheit thermometer)]

#### Hypothesis
We do not yet have a hypothesis as to why the programs give different results. We suspect it has something to do with the different methods both programs use, but we don’t know enough about this yet.

[RJCB: I enjoy the honesty here! Please keep preferring to do so over bluffing :-)]

#### Methods

#### Results
We do not have any results yet.

#### Conclusion
None yet.

#### Discussion
None, because we have no results yet.
